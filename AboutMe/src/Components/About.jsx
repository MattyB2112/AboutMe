          Where to begin? My love of coding stemmed from an early (and
          incredibly avid) interest in videogames that I still have to this day.
          During the great lockdown of '0-twenty, I realised I finally had the
          time to dedicate to pursual of this interest. <br />
          <br />I first started using YouTube and Udemy, following tutorials on
          C++, and learning about variables, scope, loops, and, of course, the
          world-renowned console.log().
